            "text": "<p>My love affair with beauty began in my teens, but I never felt all that confident about my beauty expertise. I still don’t, to be honest. The art of applying makeup. The science of knowing what skincare to use when, and in what order. It always felt intimidating. Doing anything beyond a basic blowout on my own hair? Forget it.<br/><br/>It was in the midst of Covid that inspiration struck. I’d been working out with a fitness mirror and getting into Peloton too. I loved the idea that technology was making my workouts better and making me a healthier, happier person. Even more, I was moved by the community support I got along the way (especially during lockdown) – the affirmation for hitting a new milestone, doing another rep, or even for just showing up.<br/><br/>Then it hit me. This was exactly the kind of experience I needed in my beauty life. What if there were a beauty mirror that offered more than just reflection? With guidance and inspiration built right in. Connection to other beauty lovers too.<br/><br/>As this idea continued to take shape in my head, I connected with a tech partner in Europe, and we set off on the journey that led to SWAN. This mirror is more than an innovation, it’s a passion. A chance to create a beauty community that’s all love and no judgment. Join us.<br/><br/>Let’s reimagine routines together.<br/>Let’s share trends and tips.<br/>Let’s inspire creativity.<br/>Let’s collaborate.<br/>Let’s SWAN.<br/><br/>With love,<br/><strong>Colby Mitchell, <br/>Co-Founder & CEO<br/></strong></p>",
